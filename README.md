# Welcome to the Pack! 

You're here because we value you and your relationship with Devocate, and our founder—Tessa Kriesel.

Devocate's mission follows the Community-led model—meaning that we lead with relationships and connections versus revenue and growth. Like wolves, we're here to support our users and pack members. 

## Why "Pack?"

A pack is not just a group of wolves who hunt together **but a group of animals who live, bond, and share knowledge** across many generations. 

A wolf pack is a perfect example of well organized and structured group where **everyone cares for each other. They play together, they take care of each other when someone is sick or injured, and they mourn and suffer when a member of the pack dies.**

## What does joining the Pack mean?

Joining Devocate's pack means that you support what we're doing and you want to help us find success. It's really that simple. 

In terms of actual logistics, it means that we will curate ways that you can support us, and find ways to support you in return. You share feedback openly, and help us become better, together. 

### Is there a minimum commitment?

Absolutely not. We will share campaigns we are focused on and ways that you can get involved. If the passion moves you, then dive in, if not, then don't. We will still love and support you either way.
